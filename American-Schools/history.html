            <h2>The History of American Schools</h2>
            <p>American schools have a rich history that dates back to the early colonial days. Over time, they have evolved, influenced by various cultural, political, and social changes.</p>
            <h3>Early Education</h3>
            <p>The first public schools in America were established in the 17th century. These early schools were focused on reading, writing, and religious education. The first public school, the Boston Latin School, was founded in 1635.</p>
            <h3>Development and Change</h3>
            <p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the structure of American schools evolved to provide education for a growing population. High schools became more widespread in the early 20th century, and by the mid-1900s, public schools began integrating students of different races.</p>
